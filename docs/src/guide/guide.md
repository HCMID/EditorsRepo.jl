The goal of the EditorsRepo.jl package is to bridge the gap between a local file system of editing work in progress, and more general structures such as "a corpus of citable texts" (`CitableText.Corpus`) or "a record associating texts, image and physical surface" (from the `Dse` package).

Some concepts are more specific to editorial work, such as functions to ensure different kinds of consistency in recording, such as referential integrity, and internal completeness of records.
