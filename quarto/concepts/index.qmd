EditorsRepo.jl lets you work with files of editing work in progress in a local file system using more abstract structures such as "a corpus of citable texts" (`CitableText.Corpus`) or "a record associating texts, image and physical surface" (from the `CitablePhysicalText` module).

One important application built with EditorsRepo.jl is the Pluto notebook providing interactive validation and verification of work in progress. (You can find it in the `notebooks` directory of the template github repository [here](https://github.com/HCMID/validatormodel).)



## Define a repository

An `EditingRepository` works with three kinds of data: text editions, indexes of text passages to images and physical surfaces, and configuration data specifying how to transform the edition files into citable texts. The repository expects each type of data to be managed in a separate directory.  By default, their names are `editions`, `config` and `dse`.
