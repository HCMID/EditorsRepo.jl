Construct an `EditingRepository` from a root directory containing
all three required directories.

## (1) Archival editions

## (2) DSE records


## (3) Configuration files

Create a `config` directory with two files, named `catalog.cex` and `citation.cex`.



- `catalog.cex`

This is a delimited-text file cataloging a text for use with Canonical Text Services.  Here is an example entry:


```
#!ctscatalog
urn|citationScheme|groupName|workTitle|versionLabel|exemplarLabel|online|language
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.e3.hmt:|book, scholion|Homeric scholia|Scholia to the Iliad|Escorial Î¥ 1.1||true|grc
```

:::{.callout-note title="Note"}
Note the required block label `#!ctscatalog` preceding the header line with names of columns.
:::



- `citation.cex`

This is a delimited-text file mapping the canonical citation of a text onto a specific source file. 

Here is an example entry:


```
urn|file|converter|diplomatic|normalized|orthography
urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.e3.hmt:8|e3_scholia08.xml|TEIThreeDivsGrouped|MidDiplomaticBuilder("Diplomatic edition builder","dipl")|MidNormalizedBuilder("Normalized edition builder","normed")|msGreek()
```




If the required directories are named "editions", "dse" and "config",
`repodir` is the only parameter needed.  Optionally, you may supply names for any of those directories relative to `reporoot`.
